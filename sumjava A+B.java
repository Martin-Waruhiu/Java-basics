/**. Sum A + B
A sum-based project is a great way to get started with Java programming. The project is quite 
simple â€” the user will input two numbers (which are treated as the variables A and B), and the
 program will add them together and present the sum of A + B. This can help you learn to work with methods and integers
 . JavaTPoint offers a great guide for a Sum A + B project, 
 and working through this type of project can help you become familiar with Java processes.
